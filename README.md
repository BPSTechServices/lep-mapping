# Limited English Proficiency (LEP) & Immigrant Community Mapping
This analysis uses spatial statistical techniques to derive "language overlays" for critical languages in Portland, OR. Critical languages are those that have 1,000 or more speakers with limited English proficiency. The overlays are intended to delineate soft boundaries for where interpretation and translation services should be provided. Because tract-level American Community Survey (ACS) data are not available for certain critical languages, this analysis is supplemented with ACS data on countries of birthplace for the foreign-born population. This is an imprecise measurement, but it is a better proxy to identify locations of immigrant and LEP communities.
